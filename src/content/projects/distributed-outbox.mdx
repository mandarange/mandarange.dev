## Problem Statement

In a microservices architecture, ensuring that database updates and message publishing happen atomically is a common challenge.

## Approach

I implemented the **Transactional Outbox Pattern** to decouple database transactions from message publishing.

<Callout type="principle">
  Always favor strong consistency in the data layer and eventual consistency in the messaging layer.
</Callout>

## Outcome

- **99.99% Reliability** in message delivery.
- Zero data loss during network partitions.
- Simplified service logic.
