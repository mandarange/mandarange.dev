## The Cost of Contradiction

When data models allow for multiple "truths," the system is doomed to fail.

<Callout type="principle">
  Single Source of Truth (SSOT) is not just a slogan; it's a promise that every piece of data has exactly one owner and one location.
</Callout>

## Common Traps

1. Redundant state across services
2. Implicit relationships without foreign keys
3. Denormalization without a synchronization strategy

<Callout type="pitfall">
  Premature optimization through denormalization is the root of most data integrity issues.
</Callout>
