## About

Daniel Choi is a software engineer whose career spans game graphics and shader development, cross-platform app engineering, and platform architecture for commerce systems. He currently serves as CTO at Hypercape Inc. (K-beauty commerce infrastructure) and CEO at WeKlem Inc. (cross-platform development studio, est. 2021).

## Engineering Philosophy

Daniel's work is guided by six pillars:

1. **Data IS the Product** — SSOT (Single Source of Truth) is the top priority. Copies breed operational cost explosions. Schema reviews before feature reviews.
2. **Operational Simplicity** — Idempotent operations, transactional consistency, and clear state management. Design for partial failure.
3. **Security as Infrastructure** — Enforced at the DB and policy level. Audit trails, IP restrictions, admin tooling.
4. **Systems Beat Individuals** — Dev standards, PR/review routines, checklists, and decision records. Consistent systems outperform individual heroics.
5. **Documentation as Operational Tools** — PRDs, playbooks, decision records, migration scenarios, and checklists. They recur because they work.
6. **AI-Era Readiness** — Documentation and structure must be machine-readable. Engineers who structure knowledge for AI access multiply their output.
